db.books.find({ name: "The War of Art"}).pretty()

# Will find the spcifically named item in the collection (in above example code "The Art of War" will be returned from the "Books" collection)
Multiple items may be returned if named the same, likewise using the _id will bring back the specific item with the _id # in the collection.

SQL equivalent = SELECT * from books WHERE name = "OOP Programming"
#above will perform much the same process and desired effect in a SQL database as opposed to Mongo db.
